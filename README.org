* hot_scan


hot_scan is a free software to detect genomic regions unusually rich in translocation breakpoints. More generally, hot_scan may be used to detect a region that is unusually rich in a given character of a binary sequence. The significance of these regions is determined by using scan statistics, see for instance Glaz, J., Naus, J., and Wallenstein, S. (2001). Scan Statistics. Springer, NY.
